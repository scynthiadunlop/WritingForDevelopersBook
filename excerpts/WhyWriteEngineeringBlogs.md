# Why Write Engineering Blogs

*The following text is an excerpt from Chapter 1*

If you want to start writing technical blogs but are desperately looking for a compelling motive to finally take action, you've come to the right place. And if you’re an experienced writer who has fallen out of practice, perhaps a few moments reflecting on the benefits will inspire you to re-prioritize writing.

Here are some of the many reasons to write engineering blog posts...  

## Leaving your comfort zone

Enjoying small personal challenges is often “a thing” for programmers. It may manifest as:
 - Coding daily HackerRank challenges
 - Participating in the Advent of Code
 - Enduring personal all-night hackathons
 - Finishing the 100 pushups program
 - Catching up on those long-abandoned piano lessons

… so why not write a blog post or two, just to show yourself that you can do it? Getting started requires an act of willpower, and the outcome is just as satisfying as finally figuring out the asymptotically optimal solution for an algorithmic problem you've been trying to solve for hours.

## Really understanding your code

Want to see if you really understand your code? Try explaining it to someone else. Writing a blog post can help you with that.
First of all, you need to articulate the problem and solution in natural language. That's proven to be a helpful debugging mechanism, and even earned an adorable name: rubber duck debugging. Instead of talking to a bathtub toy, you can write your thoughts down for other people to read and learn from. 

Writing a blog post sometimes exposes that your code has a terrible logical fallacy, missed a corner case, or was designed incorrectly. Quite often, blogging becomes yet another part of the iterative programming technique. Describing the design and implementation becomes just a phase of development, followed by returning to the code to fix the mistakes and rethink incorrect assumptions.

All those blog posts also improve knowledge retention. If you can just redirect somebody to your blog post instead of explaining your design decisions over and over one-on-one, it saves everyone’s time. And if you move on, it's nice to know that people who take over the code can onboard themselves with your articles describing how you found and fixed the issues.   

You also tend to get your work vetted by the community, as described in the next section.

## Free peer review

Code review is a vital part of most successful programming projects. Very few people have the superhero brains capable of hacking a complicated system on their own and maintaining it later. The more people review the code, the better. A small number of reviewers can lead to bias, especially in small startup companies where like-minded people collaborate on a common problem. 

Writing a public blog post is an implicit call for (unsolicited) help. One certain thing about the online community of programmers is that they love pointing out other people's mistakes and suggesting their own ideas as ultimate sources of truth.

Our dear colleague Pekka Enberg often jokingly says: "Don't read the comment sections on the orange site” [Referring to the distinctive coloring theme of the Hacker News web page]. Although the online commentary is negative more often than not, it's still just as valuable, maybe even more so. Comment sections on various web pages are accurately called "cesspits" and other derogatory terms. Yet, among all the vitriol, you can often find genuine suggestions on how to improve. It's quite common for authors to publish an errata for both the blog post and the corresponding code because somebody was kind enough to point out a mistake in the comment section.

## Personal brand boost
Thousands of self-proclaimed life coaches infiltrating social media sites try to convince you that improving your personal brand is very important – especially if you want to earn tens of thousands of dollars a day, just like them. Writing blog posts isn’t a direct line to wealth, but it certainly is a good start for earning recognition and respect across the tech community.

Publishing a blog post is usually naturally followed by promoting it on social media. You’ll want to share your own blog post in a non-cringey way (we’ll talk more about this later) and the publisher (often your company) will most likely promote it too. That's a prime opportunity to slowly build your audience and get noticed. A good blog post can earn you the label of "that person who wrote an interesting article on XYZ." This builds the foundation for a personal brand. 

That "seed" audience helps expand your reach. If you write additional blog posts or comments on topics that resonate with this group, they’re likely to share your posts across their own network. Rinse, repeat, and you’ll be an influencer writing viral content in no time (or, in reality, you’ll gain a reputation for writing blogs worth reading and sharing). Having a large group of regular readers also increases the chances of your blog post landing on the trending list of an article aggregator, like Hacker News or Reddit.

Once you’ve reached some critical mass of exposure, interesting people start approaching you and leaders in that space begin to recognize you as an expert. Blogs are a prime hunting ground for publishers, conference organizers, and other talent scouts. It’s not uncommon for a single successful blog post to spark invitations to meetups, conferences, discussion panels, podcasts, etc. Others might just contact you with a congratulatory note. Regardless of the reason, each such contact is an opportunity to stay in touch with a community peer who cares about what you've been working on.

If you have a personal web page, a list of your published blog posts is a great addition to it. And if you don't have a personal web page, the fact that you can list your published blog posts is a great excuse to go and build one!

## Career development
Once you've published at least one blog post, there's one thing you can be certain of: armies of LinkedIn talent sourcers have already found it and are ready to put the title in that first (and only) customized sentence of an otherwise templated message: "Hi \<your slightly misspelled name here>, I read your article on \<the blog post topic>, it was such a treat! I am also impressed beyond belief by your experience at (...)". 

But the benefits of blogging go beyond slightly more customized poaching attempts. You're also standing out for CTOs and founders of startups that work in the same industry, who might have genuinely enjoyed that technical take of yours. When the people reaching out to you have taken the time to read your work and track you down, it’s fair to expect that 1) the position will be well-aligned with your interests and 2) you’ll skip to the front of the hiring line. 

Even if your blog doesn’t directly land you new job opportunities, listing compelling blog posts on your resume helps you stand out in a crowded applicant pool. And if one of those blogs links to a Hacker News discussion with an impressive amount of points – or shows some nice engagement via Medium claps, social media reactions, etc. – it’s even more prestigious. Put yourself in the hiring manager’s shoes. Would you rather spend time on someone who has authored an intelligible blog post on a technology that the team uses, or someone who simply tosses the technology name into a long laundry list of “competencies.”

Blogs are also helpful for internal advancement. Wish leaders who don’t read code had some idea what you’ve accomplished and the challenges you faced? This is your chance. Moreover, publishing an impactful blog could help make the case for a promotion. For example, completing and communicating a significant technical achievement is often a key factor for promotion to Staff Engineer. And remember the pain of completing the “what you did this year” section of the dreaded annual performance review forms? Having blog post URLs is quite handy when it’s time to remember what you did and explain complex projects in n characters or less.

Moreover, the writing skills that you develop and refine while working on blogs help your career in other ways too. For example, if you want your design decisions to be adopted, you will need to communicate their merit in writing so your ideas can be reviewed asynchronously by multiple stakeholders.  Being able to produce correct code is one thing. If you want to have a greater influence, you often need to convince others (and sometimes yourself as well) that your proposed specification, architecture, and design all make sense.

## Staying on top of the latest technologies
Readers turn to tech blogs to learn about modern technology, bleeding edge software, and the latest groundbreaking hardware. When a new CPU architecture gets released, you can expect to see a surge of articles describing how it works (or doesn't), if it's a good fit for some specific use cases, if it was a life-changing performance boost for somebody, or if it was rather disappointing after running some real-life benchmarks. 

Given that there’s a sizable audience hungry for new content about new technologies, why not volunteer to learn and share something interesting? That's a very healthy environment for an engineer – staying up to date with modern technology quickly pays off. It not only helps you with your daily duties, but also increases the chances you're still a valuable asset on the job market in case you ever want (or require) a career change. We all know firsthand that it's quite tempting to become lazy in a cushy programming job (please don't tell my boss that I typed that), and regular blogging about the latest technologies is a perfect remedy for this.

Weekend programming projects also help – twofold. Of course, they help you stay up-to-date with the latest tech. But what's more important here, they’re great material for a blog post. A fair number of popular technical blog posts are just descriptions of unusual (e.g. reverse-engineering a Christmas lights controller), nerdy (e.g. a new toy Raft implementation), melancholic (e.g. one about your good ol' gameboy™), or otherwise impressive weekend projects.

## Improving your skills
Blog posts are a perfect training ground for all kinds of skills, not just technical ones.
### Writing
Writing proficiency comes with practice. The more you write, the better you become at expressing ideas, structuring content, and crafting clear sentences. Consistent practice (and feedback) contributes significantly to your writing skills. It also helps you find and polish your writing style. 

With each post you write, the next one becomes easier and more natural, like another entry in your diary. Every time you write, you’re essentially considering and navigating countless decisions with every word, sentence, and revision. Each negotiation builds up a personal knowledge base that you can subconsciously tap the next time you’re stuck. And confronting your own writing challenges prepares you to provide constructive feedback for other people's blog posts. That, in turn, creates a healthy writing culture among your colleagues and peers.

### Language
Regular writing sessions provide an opportunity to enhance language skills in the context of your work. This is especially valuable for non-native English speakers. You’ll be forced to think hard about vocabulary (both technical and non-technical), grammar, and overall proficiency. It's a great exercise, especially in the age of automatic grammar-checking software and all kinds of tools for finding synonyms, antonyms, and all the other -nyms. Rather than mechanically accepting suggestions, you learn as you go! 
### Engineering
Writing a blog post creates internal pressure to verify all the information you're about to publish under your name. It compels you to research the topic, double-check that the code snippets are sensible and correct, and browse the Internet for similar articles. And that's great! It is motivation to learn in its purest form – because if you don't do it, you may make a fool of yourself online. You usually won't, of course, but try and explain that to your impostor syndrome.
