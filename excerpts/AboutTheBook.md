# Preface
Engineering blogs feed and foster developers’ insatiable curiosity. Think of all the times that a blog post:
 - Sparked an idea for a new approach or project
 - Taught you about a new technology or tool that you ended up trying out
 - Saved you from going down a disastrous path
 - Led you to an aha moment in the depths of despair
 - Gave your project an unexpected lift
 - Pushed you to apply for a dream job

Engineering blogs clearly matter. And we’re both obsessed with them, from two rather different angles (the engineering side and the writing side).
This book began as a crazy idea, a challenge to ourselves. If we collaborated, with our vastly different experiences and perspectives, could we come up with a resource that would bring more, and better, engineering blogs into the world? Could we help hesitant developers overcome the barriers preventing them from sharing their ideas in writing? Could we also help experienced engineering blog writers increase their reach and impact?

We didn’t pretend to know all the secrets to creating amazing engineering blog posts (we still don’t). But we wanted to think deeply about it, learn more, and share what we knew. So we committed to writing a book on it – as a “weekend project” that sprawled into early mornings and evenings across different sides of the globe. And here we are.

While this book focuses on writing engineering blog posts, the strategies you learn will help you make *all* your technical communications clearer and more compelling. Software engineering involves a surprising amount of writing – commit messages, code comments, API docs, design docs, requests for comments [RFCs], progress reports, bug report threads, code review comments, async team messages, user interactions, and oh all the emails. Through these channels, strong writing skills will naturally increase your impact as an engineer. That leads to more interesting engineering experiences, which in turn leads to more interesting blog posts that further increase your impact. It’s a “virtuous cycle.”

We’ve had a ton of fun writing this book, and we truly hope you enjoy reading it and applying it to your writing. We look forward to reading what *you* write!

# About this book

This book will guide you to write more compelling engineering blog posts – ones that get read, shared, discussed, and remembered. You benefit from two distinctly different perspectives: an engineer who learned to enjoy writing and a writer who spent decades collaborating with engineers. As long as you’re interested in writing and have interesting engineering experiences to write about, we can help! 

We cover pragmatic strategies for optimizing all phases of the blogging process, from planning to promoting. Specifically, we explore:

 - Identifying and prioritizing topics that make intriguing posts
 - Getting a draft written and reviewed as painlessly as possible
 - Making your ideas clearer and more convincing to technical readers
 - Tapping the strengths of AI for revision while avoiding misuses and abuses
 - Squeezing more value out of each blog post that you publish
 - Using your blogging success as a stepping stone to additional opportunities

One of the best ways to improve your craft is to learn from the masters. Early in the book, we discuss core characteristics shared across successful blog posts and show how they’re applied in real-world examples. However, a captivating bug hunt article varies dramatically from an opinion piece roasting a highly hyped technology…or an article that shares how a team implemented an industry-changing algorithm. That’s why the heart of the book involves in-depth analysis of these and other blog post “patterns” – exploring examples, characteristics, and dos/don’ts for each. By the time you’re done reading, you’ll start seeing these patterns everywhere and (we hope!) applying them to shape your own blog posts.

# Who should read this book
This book is designed for developers, engineers, and technical leaders of all writing skill levels — even if you’re not a native English speaker and never took a writing class in your life. It assumes that you’re tackling interesting engineering challenges and want to share your experiences, achievements, and lessons learned with the community. It is most likely to resonate with people who are: 
 - Building the next big thing at a startup
 - Working on intriguing projects at larger tech companies
- Spearheading open-source projects
 - Aspiring to any of the above 

Note that this book does *not* focus on blogging for profit (e.g., writing freelance articles about what someone else developed). Also, it was not written with DevRel or Product Marketing professionals in mind. However, people in those roles might find many parts helpful – especially if they collaborate closely with engineers. 

# How this book is organized: a roadmap

This book includes seventeen chapters divided into four parts, plus an Appendix.

Part 1: Fundamentals

 - Chapter 1 explores the benefits of writing engineering blog posts as well as common excuses for not writing them 
 - Chapter 2 helps you identify topics for compelling blog posts
 - Chapter 3 shares critical characteristics of compelling blog posts

Part 2: Nailing the writing process
 - Chapter 4 walks you through capturing your ideas and getting to a working draft
 - Chapter 5 helps you optimize the draft so it resonates with your target readers
 - Chapter 6 is all about getting the feedback you want/need before publication
 - Chapter 7 delineates what to check as you send the post off into the world

Part 3: Applying blog post patterns 
 - Chapter 8 analyzes “Bug Hunt” blog posts that share the thrill of finding and fixing some elusive bug 
 - Chapter 9 analyzes “Rewrote It in X” blog posts that are all about rewriting an app in a new programming language, library, or framework
 - Chapter 10 analyzes “How We Built It” blog posts that share your most impressive engineering achievements
 - Chapter 11 analyzes “Lessons Learned” blog posts that share lessons learned from technical challenges
 - Chapter 12 analyzes “Thoughts on Trends” blog posts that are highly opinionated takes on industry trends
 - Chapter 13 analyzes “Non-Markety Product Perspectives” blog posts where the product is embedded into a genuinely intriguing and educational article 
 - Chapter 14 analyzes “Benchmarks and Test Results” blog posts that share various flavors of benchmarks and tests

Part 4: Promotion, adaptation, and expansion
 - Chapter 15 presents options for squeezing more value from your initial blog post 
 - Chapter 16 shares strategies for presenting conference talks based on your blog post
 - Chapter 17 provides an honest look at what to consider if you’re intrigued with becoming a book author

Appendix
