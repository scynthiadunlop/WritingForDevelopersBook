*Writing For Developers: Blogs That Get Read* is a practical guide to writing more compelling engineering blog posts. 

We discuss strategies for optimizing all phases of the blog writing process: planning, drafting, revision -- even promotion and extension. And we have quite a bit of fun exploring the core blog post patterns that are most common across engineering blogs today, like “The Bug Hunt,” “How We Built It,” “Lessons Learned,” “We Rewrote It in X,” “Thoughts on Trends,” etc. Each "pattern" chapter includes an analysis of five real-world examples as well as specific dos/don’ts for that particular pattern. There's a section on moving from blogging into opportunities such as article writing, conference speaking, and book writing. Finally, we leave you with a playful look at generative AI uses and abuses for blog writing.

Oh...and there's also a foreword by Bryan Cantrill and an afterword by Scott Hanselman!

## Write That Blog!
As a not-so-subtle hint to our readers, we created https://writethat.blog. We’ll be continuously updating this site with interesting engineering blog posts, including Piotr’s pundit commentary.

## Reviews
“There is no better way for an engineer to supercharge their growth, develop their career, and make a lasting mark on the world than by writing about their work, yet a very small fraction of us ever do so. This book is full of simple, practical guidance for improving your craft and increasing your impact on the industry. I will be recommending it far and wide.”  **\- Charity Majors, Co-founder and CTO at Honeycomb**

“A great blog can help put your career onto the fast track, and this is the book telling you how. A must-read!” **\- Gunnar Morling, Software Engineer at Decodable**

“Writing is a way to garbage collect your thoughts into a clear narrative, not just for the audience but for the individual.  Most content is noise and boring, and learning to distill the important makes you a clear thinker. It is a grueling process - for me - moving from frustration to eureka, especially if your wife is a literature major. *Writing for Developers* is a down-to-earth manuscript with a punk rock DIY attitude that demystifies the process and helps authors move past the writer’s block that we all face. A fun read to make you a better writer.” **\- Alex Gallego, Founder and CEO of Redpanda** 

"Afraid of writing blog posts? Afraid of your boss who wants you to write blog posts? This comprehensive guide to writing engineer-oriented blog posts is for you!" **\- Avi Kivity, CTO and Co-founder of ScyllaDB**  

"This book packs years of experience into a convenient guide targeted to software engineers. It'll help you write more effectively so you can write better blogs in less time. **\- Pekka Enberg, CTO and Co-founder of Turso**

“For dev-focused startups, blogging is do-or-die. This book offers lots of actionable tips, even for those of us who have been writing for years. Plus, it’s a seriously fun read.” **\- Glauber Costa, CEO and Co-founder of Turso**

“Piotr and Cynthia give not merely guidance on how to write, but suggestions of what to write – of unearthing the narrative arcs that naturally occur within the work of software practitioners. The book is loaded with specific examples of writing in the wild that can serve as object lessons.” **\- Bryan Cantrill, Co-founder and CTO of Oxide Computer** 

"Piotr and Cynthia have both been tremendously helpful to me with writing and communicating effectively, and it's so exciting to see their wisdom distilled and shared with the world. If you're writing for developers, the best decision you can make is to read *Writing for Developers*." **\- Bo Ingram, Author of ScyllaDB in Action**  

"If you're reading this book, you're already one step ahead, because you understand the best programming language we've ever created is the one you've known since you were four years old." **\-Jeff Atwood, Coding Horror Owner/Writer, Co-founder of Stack Overflow**
