# Writing For Developers: Blogs That Get Read
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DWTAFt53L._SY385_.jpg" align="right"/>

This book guides you to write more compelling engineering blog posts that advance the developer community, your projects, and your own career. We cover pragmatic strategies for optimizing all phases of the blog writing process, from planning, to drafting and revision, to promotion and extension. And we have quite a bit of fun exploring the core blog post patterns that are most common across engineering blogs today (e.g., “The Bug Hunt,” “How We Built It,” “Lessons Learned,” “We Rewrote It in X,” “Thoughts on Trends,” etc.) – with analysis of real-world examples and specific dos/don’ts for each pattern. 

The book is complete! It's currently in the production phase, and heading off to the printers soon. You can purchase it from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Developers-Blogs-that-read/dp/1633436284/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2QWJZGPI5YDV2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.n4PTUEfL33sdEnpF9gpHW6kR5nFOW353nRfYqeMhONcPGxPAOJpxntbJV0ct8wDS8Q8gTMHJAK5F455GQA4Ya_tx5IOigXJc4PwXI2jjCZA.BDsekcICCo54-1vnKf_ryO3NVJj94UEeTVJfCvlQH0c&dib_tag=se&keywords=piotr+sarna&qid=1727152523&sprefix=piotr+sarna%2Caps%2C447&sr=8-1) or [Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/writing-for-developers?utm_source=dunlop&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_dunlop_writing_5_16_24&a_aid=dunlop&a_bid=33a8dae6&chan=mm_twitter&). 

This repository aggregates links to all the blog posts and other references we mention in the book. And as we create or encounter related writing resources, we'll add them here too.  

## WriteThatBlog!
As a not-so-subtle hint to our readers, we created https://writethat.blog. We’ll be continuously updating this site with interesting engineering blog posts, including Piotr’s pundit commentary.
